# Scaling, Auto-Scaling and Rolling out Deployments

### Because we are using a shared environment, we need to create our resources in separate namespaces , with every command below please add the suffix "-n <yourname_bitbucket_ns>" for e.g (this assumes you have created your namespace already otherwise  run "create namespace <yourname_bitbucket_ns>"
```
# kubectl create -f rc.yaml -n abhik_bitbucket_ns
replicationcontroller "soaktestrc" created
```

delete all prior pods, deployments and services

```
kubectl get pod,deploy,svc,rs,rc -o wide

kubectl delete --all deploy,pods,svc,hpa -n <your_namespace>
```

## Create a deployment and a svc

```
kubectl create -f helloworld-dep-svc.yaml
```

Check the deployments and pods

```
kubectl get po,deploy,svc -o wide
```

## Scale on an existing deployment 

Scale the deployment created in last step and see the effect on the number of pods, rs, and deployment 

```
kubectl scale deploy helloworld-all-deployment --replicas=2

#Check the scaling in "describe", at the bottom in the "Events" section, you will see that it's scaled from 1 to 2

kubectl describe deploy helloworld-all-deployment
```

## Use Auto-Scaling on an existing deployment

Add autoscale to an existing deployment helloworld-all-deployment

```
kubectl autoscale deployment helloworld-all-deployment --min=3 --max=10
```

check the HPA

```
$ kubectl get hpa
```

--- Wait for sometime, pods will get increased from 2 to 3 due to autoscaler.

### Cleanup

```
kubectl delete --all deploy,pods,svc,hpa -n <your_namespace>
```


## Functionality of Roll outs and Roll Backs

We will use the yaml files located in this section 

`https://github.com/shekhar2010us/kubernetes_teach_git/blob/master/ex4/navbar-black.yaml`

Create the deployment and service for the navbar

```
$ kubectl create -f navbar-black.yaml
```

```
$ kubectl get po,deploy,svc --show-labels -o wide 
```

get the port for the LoadBalancer and check the URL for the node with the port

`http://<public_ip_address>:<LoadBalancer_exposed_port>`

Rollout a new deployment

```
$ kubectl set image deploy/header-deployment navbarworld=karthequian/helloworld:blue
```

Check the current status on pods , Deployment and replicasets (we will see a new replica set starting up, and now we will have 2 instances of the replica set)

```
$ kubectl get po,deploy,rs --show-labels -o wide
```

We can also do a describe on the replica set, and we shall see gradually all the pods moving to the other replica set

```
$ kubectl describe deploy header-deployment
```

Try to hit the front end again, and we should see the header change to blue from black
`http://<public_ip_address>:<LoadBalancer_exposed_port>`

Try the rollback the deployment now, and keep monitoring the replicasets , pods and deployment

```
$ kubectl rollout undo deployment/header-deployment
```

Check the current status on pods , Deployment and replicasets (we will see the pods going back to the old replica set)

```
$ kubectl get po,deploy,rs --show-labels -o wide
```

hit the url front end again to see the color of the header turn to black again
`http://<public_ip_address>:<LoadBalancer_exposed_port>`

p.s - We can also see the history of the rollout , this is enabled by the `--record`, but sometimes may not work . Alternative is to use describe

```
$ kubectl rollout history deployment/header-deployment
```

Let's clean up

```
kubectl delete --all svc,deploy,pod,hpa --namespace=default
```
